## File Operations

| Command | Default Key | Vim Alias | Description |

### External file picker

Set `editor.file_picker` in `~/.config/sakharov/config.toml` to any shell command.
The command receives `SV_PICKER_FILE` (write the chosen path there) and `SV_CURRENT_DIR`
(directory of the current buffer). Stdout is used as a fallback if the temp file is empty.

```toml
# yazi (recommended — writes its choice to SV_PICKER_FILE automatically)
[editor]
file_picker = "yazi --chooser-file=$SV_PICKER_FILE"

# fzf (writes to stdout, which sakharov reads after it exits)
[editor]
file_picker = "find . -type f | fzf"
```

## Scripting

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `shell <cmd>` | Run a shell command via `sh -c`; first 200 chars of stdout (or stderr) shown in the status bar |
| `sequence` | (programmatic only) Run a sequence of commands in order |

## Search

| Command | Default Key | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `search-forward` | `/` | Enter forward search — type a pattern, Enter jumps to the first match below the cursor |
| `search-backward` | `?` | Enter backward search — same but jumps to the first match above the cursor |
| `search-next` | `n`, `ctrl+n` | Jump to the next match (wraps around) |
| `search-prev` | `N`, `ctrl+p` | Jump to the previous match (wraps around) |
| `grep-buffer` | `ctrl+f` | Telescope-style fuzzy line picker over the current buffer (`:grep-buffer`) |
| `grep-project` | `ctrl+g` | Project-wide grep popup via ripgrep/grep (`:grep`, `:rg`) |

Search is live: the cursor moves to the nearest match as you type. Press `Esc` to cancel and return the cursor to its original position.

## Scrolling

| Command | Default Key | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `page-down` | `ctrl+d`, `PgDn` | Scroll half a page down (cursor moves with viewport) |
| `page-up` | `ctrl+u`, `PgUp` | Scroll half a page up (cursor moves with viewport) |
| `scroll-cursor-center` | `gz` (via Goto mode) | Scroll viewport so the cursor line is vertically centred |

## LSP

| Command | Default Key | Description |

Diagnostics are shown inline (underline) and as an error/warning count in the status
bar, for both plain files and per-cell in notebook mode. They are keyed by the
document's resolved absolute path, so they work regardless of whether the file was
opened by a relative or absolute path.

## Editing

| Command | Default Key | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `kill-to-end-of-line` | `ctrl+k` | Delete from cursor to end of line; killed text goes to clipboard |

## Popup / UI

| Command | Default Key | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `open-command-palette` | `Space` | Open fuzzy-searchable command palette (`:palette`, `:commands`). Recently-used commands float toward the top — see *Command history* below |
| `open-buffer-picker` | — | Fuzzy picker over open buffers (`:buffers`) |
| `open-symbol-picker` | — | Fuzzy picker over tree-sitter symbols in the buffer (`:symbols`) |
| `open-diagnostic-picker` | — | Fuzzy picker over all LSP diagnostics (`:diagnostics`) |

| `toggle-relative-line-numbers` | — | Toggle relative line numbers (shows distance from current line) |
| `toggle-word-wrap` | — | Toggle soft word-wrap (`:wrap` / `:word-wrap`) |

### Command history (palette recency)

The command palette remembers commands you invoke (via the palette or the `:`
command line — never plain keystroke motions) and floats recent ones toward the
top. Recency is a **tiebreaker only**: a better fuzzy match always still wins, so
recency only reorders matches of equal match quality, and orders the list when the
filter is empty. Configure with `ui.command_history` in `config.toml`:

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `"session"` (default) | Recency kept in memory only, reset each launch. Nothing written to disk. |
| `"global"` | Persisted to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/sakharov/command_history.json` and restored across restarts. |
| `"off"` | No recency weighting (alphabetical-within-tier, as before). |

## Persistence & crash recovery

While a buffer has unsaved edits, its contents are periodically flushed to a
private recovery file under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/sakharov/recovery/` (owner-only
`0600`, written atomically). The file is removed on a clean save and on a clean
quit, so it only lingers after a crash or kill. Covered buffers: plain-text
files, the scratch buffer, and notebooks (`.ipynb`).

When you reopen a file (or the editor itself) and a recovery file exists whose
contents differ from what's on disk, sakharov prompts you to **Restore** the
unsaved contents or **Discard** them. Disable the whole feature by setting
`editor.crash_recovery = false` in `config.toml`.

## Code Folding (plain-text editor)

Press `z` in Normal mode to enter Fold sub-mode; the available keys are shown in a popup.

| Command | Default Key | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `enter-fold-mode` | `z` | `:fold` | Enter fold sub-mode (shows key hint popup) |
| `fold-toggle` | `za` | `:fold-toggle` | Toggle fold on the innermost foldable region at the cursor |
| `fold-toggle-all` | `zA` | `:fold-toggle-all` | Toggle all folds: close all if any are open, else open all |

Foldable constructs are detected via tree-sitter:
- **Python**: `def`, `class`, `for`, `while`, `if`, `with`, `try`, decorated definitions
- **Rust**: `fn`, `impl`, `struct`, `enum`, `trait`, `mod`, `match`, closures
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `function`, arrow functions, `class`, `if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`, `try`

A fold indicator line shows the first line of the folded region with a `▶ N lines` badge.
The cursor is automatically snapped past folds when moving down, and to the fold-start when moving up.

## Notebook Cell Folding

| Command | Default Key | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `notebook-toggle-fold-cell` | `z` (notebook mode) | `:fold-cell` | Toggle collapse of the focused cell |
| `notebook-toggle-all-folds` | `Z` (notebook mode) | `:fold-all-cells` | Toggle all cells: fold all if any are expanded, else unfold all |

A folded cell shows: first line of source + `▶ N lines · M outputs` indicator.
Entering edit mode (`i`) on a folded cell auto-unfolds it.

## Notebooks

Opening a `.ipynb` file (or `:nb` / `:notebook` on an already-open one) enters
**Notebook mode**. Cells are shown as a vertical stack; `j`/`k` move between cells
(Navigate). Press `i` to edit the focused cell in place, `Enter` for a full-screen
cell-edit overlay, and `Esc`/`v` to return to Navigate. The default keys below apply
in Notebook Navigate mode.

### Navigation & editing

| Command | Default Key | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `enter-notebook` | — | `:nb`, `:notebook` | Enter Notebook mode (opens the buffer's `.ipynb` if needed) |
| `notebook-next-cell` | `j`, `↓` | — | Focus the next cell |
| `notebook-prev-cell` | `k`, `↑` | — | Focus the previous cell |
| `notebook-scroll-down` | — | — | Scroll the cell viewport down without moving focus |
| `notebook-scroll-up` | — | — | Scroll the cell viewport up without moving focus |

### Execution & kernel

| Command | Default Key | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `notebook-execute-cell` | `e` | `:run` | Execute the focused cell in the persistent kernel |
| `notebook-execute-and-advance` | `E` | `:run-next` | Execute the focused cell, then focus the next |
| `notebook-restart-kernel` | `ctrl+r` | `:restart-kernel`, `:kernel-restart` | Kill and restart the kernel (clears all state) |
| `notebook-interrupt-kernel` | — | `:interrupt-kernel`, `:kernel-interrupt` | Send SIGINT to the running kernel |

In Notebook mode, `g` enters Goto mode and the usual LSP bindings work on the focused
cell (`gd`, `gr`, `K`, `ga`, …); `:` opens the command line and `ctrl+s` saves the
notebook back to disk.
